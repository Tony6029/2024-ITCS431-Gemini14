## 1. Functional Requirements

The functional requirements define the specific behavior and functionalities that the Gemini web application must support.

### 1.1 User Management

* Users can create, update, and delete accounts.
* Role-based access control to manage permissions for different user roles (e.g., Admin, Astronomer).

### 1.2 Observation Scheduling

* Users can create, modify, and cancel observation schedules.
* The system should notify users of scheduling conflicts.

### 1.3 Data Synchronization with OCS

* Real-time synchronization with the Observatory Control System (OCS) for accurate observation data.
* Error handling for failed synchronization attempts.

### 1.4 Report Generation

* Generate observation reports in PDF and CSV formats.
* Users can filter and export specific data sets.

### 1.5 Data Visualization

* Provide graphical visualization of observation data (e.g., charts, graphs).
* Interactive dashboards for real-time data analysis.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify the performance, security, usability, and other operational criteria.

### 2.1 Performance Requirements

* The system must support at least 1000 concurrent users.
* Response time should not exceed 2 seconds for standard operations.

### 2.2 Security Requirements

* Implement AES 256 encryption for data transmission.
* Secure login mechanisms with multi-factor authentication.

### 2.3 Scalability

* The system should allow for future expansion without major architecture changes.

### 2.4 Availability

* Ensure 99.9% uptime with robust failover mechanisms.

### 2.5 Usability

* Intuitive UI/UX design to minimize the learning curve.
* Support for both desktop and mobile platforms.

### 2.6 Maintainability

* The codebase should be modular and well-documented.
* Easy deployment with automated CI/CD pipelines.
